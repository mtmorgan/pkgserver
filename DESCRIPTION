Description: Use `install()` for fast binary package
    installation. This 'front-end' must connect with an archive server
    capable of building and providing binary package versions. When
    the archive server is first asked for a versioned package, it must
    install and build the binary of the package so the process is no
    faster than a standard installation. On second and subsequent
    requests, the archive server provides a binary package for fast
    installation. Currently, the only archive server is in fact the
    package itself, so it is only capable of serving binary package
    versions to itself.
